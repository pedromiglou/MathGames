### Installing Node.js

Node.js is required for building the frontend application. It can be installing by following the instructions on the [distributions github page](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions).
Node v14 was used during development, and should be the one installed.

### Installing Yarn

Yarn was the package manager used to manage the node modules in this project, and can be installed following the instructions on the [official docs](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#debian-stable).

## Getting the Code

The code can be found in the [MathGames GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/Miglou/pi_mathgames).
The frontend web application can be found in the WebApp/mathgames_app directory.

```
git clone https://gitlab.com/Miglou/pi_mathgames.git
cd WebApp/mathgames_app
```
