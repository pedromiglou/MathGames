# Backend File Structure

This section documents the general file structure of the backend (API and Server). This structure should be followed closely when developing code to prevent confusion amongst developers and improve maintainability.

## Controllers

The **Controllers** directory contains the API's all needed controllers for the available models.

## Models

The **Models** directory has the files with the models specifications.

## Routes
